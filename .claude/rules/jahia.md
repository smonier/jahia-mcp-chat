# Jahia JavaScript Module Development

## Context

You are helping develop a **Jahia JavaScript Module** — a React-based template set for Jahia 8+. The module renders content from Jahia's JCR (Java Content Repository) using server-side React components (`.server.tsx`) and optional client-side islands (`.client.tsx`). Content is modelled in CND files, managed via Page Builder or jContent, and queried with JCR-SQL2 or GraphQL.

## Agent Principles

1. **Always invoke a skill before any Jahia task** — skills are the canonical source of patterns, gotchas, and API syntax. Never operate from memory alone.
2. **Never use `yarn dev` from an agent** — it is an interactive file watcher for human developers only. Always deploy with `yarn build && yarn jahia-deploy` (one-shot, non-interactive).
3. **Never hardcode URLs** — all navigable links must come from contributed content (JCR nodes, `j:linkType`, `buildNodeUrl`). This is a CMS: content owns the URLs.
4. **Never use `j:linkType: "external"` for internal pages** — use `"internal"` + `j:linknode`. External URLs break on environment changes, language switches, and vanity URL rewrites.
5. **Always verify before creating** — check that content types are deployed, site keys are correct, and area structures exist before attempting GraphQL mutations.
6. **All props are optional at runtime** — even mandatory CND fields. Always guard against `undefined` in views.
7. **Always include `-H "Origin: http://localhost:8080"` in every GraphQL curl** — omitting it returns `Permission denied` even with correct credentials.
8. **Build accessible HTML from the start** — every view must use semantic HTML (`<main>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`), include exactly one `<h1>` per page, use a strict heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3), add `alt` text to every `<img>`, and use sufficient colour contrast (≥ 4.5:1 for body text). Baking this in during authoring is faster than a post-hoc audit.
9. **Run one accessibility audit at the end** — after all components are built and content is published, invoke `/jahia-dev-accessibility` once to catch any remaining violations. Do not audit after every individual component; it wastes time on pages that are not yet complete.
10. **Batch builds and deploys** — build all components together, then run `yarn build && yarn jahia-deploy` once rather than after each individual component. Deploy once before populating content.
